h1 CSRF Protection

p.
	TL;DR: Probably the best way to fix this is to
	#[a(href='javascript:history.back(); window.location.reload();') #[strong go back, strong refresh the page, and try again]].

p.
	All forms on this site are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgeries.
	This type of attack occurs when a malicious website contains a link, a form button or some
	JavaScript that is intended to perform some action on your website, using the credentials of a
	logged-in user who visits the malicious site in their browser. A related type of attack, ‘login
	CSRF’, where an attacking site tricks a user’s browser into logging into a site with someone
	else’s credentials, is also covered<sup>*</sup>.

		For some reason, this protection rejected
	the data you just submitted.

p
	a.btn.btn-lg.btn-squishy(href="javascript:history.back(); window.location.reload();")
		| Go back and try again (and make sure you refresh the page)
