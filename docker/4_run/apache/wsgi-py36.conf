    #This config file is provided to give an overview of the directives,
    #which are only allowed in the 'server config' context.
    #For a detailed description of all avaiable directives please read
    #http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives


    #WSGISocketPrefix: Configure directory to use for daemon sockets.
    #
    #Apache's DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR should be the proper place for WSGI's
    #Socket. In case you want to mess with the permissions of the directory,
    #you need to define WSGISocketPrefix to an alternative directory.
    #See http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationIssues for more
    #information

        #WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/apache2/wsgi


    #WSGIPythonOptimize: Enables basic Python optimisation features.
    #
    #Sets the level of Python compiler optimisations. The default is '0'
    #which means no optimisations are applied.
    #Setting the optimisation level to '1' or above will have the effect
    #of enabling basic Python optimisations and changes the filename
    #extension for compiled (bytecode) files from .pyc to .pyo.
    #When the optimisation level is set to '2', doc strings will not be
    #generated and retained. This will result in a smaller memory footprint,
    #but may cause some Python packages which interrogate doc strings in some
    #way to fail.

        #WSGIPythonOptimize 0


    #WSGIPythonPath: Additional directories to search for Python modules,
    #                overriding the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
    #
    #Used to specify additional directories to search for Python modules.
    #If multiple directories are specified they should be separated by a ':'.

        WSGIPythonPath /opt/python/lib/python3.6/site-packages

    #WSGIPythonEggs: Directory to use for Python eggs cache.
    #
    #Used to specify the directory to be used as the Python eggs cache
    #directory for all sub interpreters created within embedded mode.
    #This directive achieves the same affect as having set the
    #PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable.
    #Note that the directory specified must exist and be writable by the user
    #that the Apache child processes run as. The directive only applies to
    #mod_wsgi embedded mode. To set the Python eggs cache directory for
    #mod_wsgi daemon processes, use the 'python-eggs' option to the
    #WSGIDaemonProcess directive instead.

        #WSGIPythonEggs directory



    #WSGIRestrictEmbedded: Enable restrictions on use of embedded mode.
    #
    #The WSGIRestrictEmbedded directive determines whether mod_wsgi embedded
    #mode is enabled or not. If set to 'On' and the restriction on embedded
    #mode is therefore enabled, any attempt to make a request against a
    #WSGI application which hasn't been properly configured so as to be
    #delegated to a daemon mode process will fail with a HTTP internal server
    #error response.

        #WSGIRestrictEmbedded On|Off



    #WSGIRestrictStdin: Enable restrictions on use of STDIN.
    #WSGIRestrictStdout: Enable restrictions on use of STDOUT.
    #WSGIRestrictSignal: Enable restrictions on use of signal().
    #
    #Well behaved WSGI applications neither should try to read/write from/to
    #STDIN/STDOUT, nor should they try to register signal handlers. If your
    #application needs an exception from this rule, you can disable the
    #restrictions here.

        #WSGIRestrictStdin On
        #WSGIRestrictStdout On
        #WSGIRestrictSignal On



    #WSGIAcceptMutex: Specify type of accept mutex used by daemon processes.
    #
    #The WSGIAcceptMutex directive sets the method that mod_wsgi will use to
    #serialize multiple daemon processes in a process group accepting requests
    #on a socket connection from the Apache child processes. If this directive
    #is not defined then the same type of mutex mechanism as used by Apache for
    #the main Apache child processes when accepting connections from a client
    #will be used. If set the method types are the same as for the Apache
    #AcceptMutex directive.

        #WSGIAcceptMutex default



    #WSGIImportScript: Specify a script file to be loaded on process start.
    #
    #The WSGIImportScript directive can be used to specify a script file to be
    #loaded when a process starts. Options must be provided to indicate the
    #name of the process group and the application group into which the script
    #will be loaded.

        #WSGIImportScript process-group=name application-group=name


    #WSGILazyInitialization: Enable/disable lazy initialisation of Python.
    #
    #The WSGILazyInitialization directives sets whether or not the Python
    #interpreter is preinitialised within the Apache parent process or whether
    #lazy initialisation is performed, and the Python interpreter only
    #initialised in the Apache server processes or mod_wsgi daemon processes
    #after they have forked from the Apache parent process.

        #WSGILazyInitialization On|Off
